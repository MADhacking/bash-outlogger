bash-outlogger
==============

A great many bash scripts require some simple output and error logging facilities such as redirecting the output of a single command or multiple commands to a file or running an application whilst simultaneously recording the output to a file and displaying it to the screen.

The bash-outlogger package provides this functionality and also provides the ability to compress large log-files, using the bzip2 compression utility, and email the resulting log-files as attachments to users using the mutt email client.
